# Stock-Prediction-
Stock Prediction using Stacked LSTM
I have designed a Recurrent Neural Network using the machine learning platform using Keras to predict the next day opening price using the past 3 days Open, High 
and Low prices and volume. I have considered Volume, Open, High and Low as features to predict the future/next day opening price. I have took the last 3 days data to predict the next day opening price.

How to run the code:
Create data folder and paste q2_dataset.csv
Create models folder
Run train_RNN.py
Run Test_RNN.py
